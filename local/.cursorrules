Code Quality Standards

The code must adhere to these fundamental principles:

Development Principles
Clean: Self-explanatory code with meaningful names and clear structure
DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself): Eliminate code duplication through proper abstraction
SOLID Principles: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion
KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Prefer simple solutions over complex ones
YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It): Don’t add functionality until it’s needed
Technical Excellence Requirements
Readable: Code should tell a story and be understandable by other developers
Testable: Write code that can be easily unit tested and integration tested
Maintainable: Easy to modify, extend, and debug
Performant: Optimized for speed, memory usage, and scalability
Secure: Follow security best practices, input validation, and XSS/CSRF protection
Reusable: Create modular components that can be used across projects
Architecture Standards
Idiomatic: Follow Bitrix conventions and PHP best practices
Functional: Leverage functional programming concepts where appropriate
Extensible: Design for future enhancements and modifications
Self-Documenting: Code should be clear enough to understand without extensive comments
Consistent: Maintain consistent coding style and patterns throughout
Resilient: Handle errors gracefully and provide fallback mechanisms
Portable: Code should work across different environments and Bitrix versions
Mobile-First & Responsive Design Philosophy
Core Approach
Always design and code mobile-first, starting with 375px viewport
Create layouts that adapt fluidly across all screen sizes without breakpoint dependencies
Implement progressive enhancement from mobile to desktop experience
CSS Techniques for Minimal Media Queries
Prefer relative units (rem, em, %, vw, vh, vmin, vmax) over fixed pixels
Implement fluid layouts using Flexbox and CSS Grid with auto-fit/auto-fill
Use CSS functions: clamp(), min(), max(), calc() for adaptive sizing
Leverage intrinsic web design principles for natural responsiveness
Apply container queries where appropriate for component-based responsive behavior
Use aspect-ratio property for maintaining proportions across devices
Implement CSS custom properties for scalable design systems
Mobile Optimization
Ensure touch-friendly interfaces with appropriate tap targets (minimum 44px)
Optimize performance for mobile networks and devices
Handle mobile hover states appropriately (use @media (hover: hover) when needed)
Optimize for fast page load speeds with mobile-first asset loading
Bitrix-Specific Requirements
Directory Structure & Organization
Place custom templates in /local/templates/ to preserve during updates
Use proper component template hierarchy: /local/templates/site_template/components/bitrix/component_name/template_name/
Organize assets (CSS, JS, images) in template directories
Follow Bitrix naming conventions for files and directories
Use ‘edsys’ prefix for custom classes and components (short site name)
Data Handling & Security
Always use $arResult and $arParams arrays for data access
Implement proper data validation and sanitization
Use Bitrix security functions: htmlspecialchars(), bitrix_sessid_post()
Check variable existence with isset() before usage
Escape output to prevent XSS attacks
Performance & Caching
Understand and work with Bitrix caching mechanisms
Optimize database queries and use proper indexing
Implement lazy loading for images and content
Minimize DOM elements and optimize CSS/JS delivery
Use composite caching where appropriate
Design & Development Constraints
Technical Restrictions
Create SEO-optimized page sections using semantic HTML
Use unique BEM class names by section to avoid conflicts with Bitrix
Add “edsys” prefix to custom classes
Avoid hover transform: translateY effects
Do not specify font sizes or font family names
Do not use CSS background gradients
Include all image attributes (width, height, loading, alt, etc.)
Use Phosphor icons with ph-thin weight class 
Implement text highlighting effects where appropriate
Ensure cross-browser compatibility
Handle errors gracefully - unhandled errors are not allowed
No deprecated methods allowed
No unused functions allowed
UX/UI Standards
Follow WCAG 2.1 accessibility guidelines compliance
Implement proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
Support keyboard navigation compatibility
Screen reader optimization
B2B Ecommerce UX/UI design principles
Modern web design trends implementation
Localization & Accessibility
Use GetMessage() for translatable strings
Support RTL languages where needed
Follow WCAG guidelines for accessibility
Implement proper semantic HTML5 and BEM CSS methodology
Code Documentation Standards
Documentation Requirements
Add meaningful comments 
Include inline comments for complex logic
Provide usage examples where helpful
Document any non-obvious business logic
Explain integration points with Bitrix components
Write all explanatory text and comments in fluent, natural Russian when requested
Always add/change versions to the files
Response Format Requirements

When providing solutions, always include:

Analysis: Briefly explain the problem and approach

Content & Context Requirements
Specialized Knowledge Areas
Focus on E-commerce B2B solutions
Event industry applications
Power distribution systems
Stage equipment management
Custom enterprise solutions
Quality Assurance
If there’s an opportunity to fix bugs or improve design and functionality, specify proposed changes and ask for confirmation before implementing
Do not modify design and functionality without explicit request
Make only requested changes and bug fixes
If requests are ambiguous, ask clarifying questions before providing solutions
Final Standards
Always provide practical, actionable advice with relevant code examples
Solutions should be immediately implementable
Emphasize mobile-first approach and demonstrate techniques that reduce media query dependency
All solutions must be production-ready and follow enterprise-level development standards
Prioritize user experience, security, and maintainability in all implementations
